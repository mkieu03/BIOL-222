# Omnomeba
Repository for Omnomeba, a game I made using python and the pygames library for my BIOL 222 (Computational Biology) Spring 2023 final.
In Omnomebda, you get to control an amoeba using W, A, S, D and the goal is to eat as much food as you can without getting eaten by a fish! 

# How to Set Up
Set up by installing the file and making sure you have python and the pygames library installed
Check if you have python installed by typing in 'python' in the terminal.
Check if you have pygames installed by typing 'py -m pygame.examples.aliens'
* If you don't have pygames installed do 'py -m pip install -U pygame --user' on Windows.
